# Notes on Design Patterns in Ruby

I've skimmed this book in the past, and use much of the material on a
daily basis, but I'm still getting a fair bit out of working my way
through it systematically.

Design Patterns in Ruby feels like one of those books which is
worthwhile revisiting every few years.

## Temporary halt

I'm up to roughly page 289, with more specs needed in
the previous chapter. Here's how to get started again:

* run ch16/packrat.rb
* examine backup.rb and backup.pr
* git grep -n TODO to find unfinished specs in ch15.
Running ch15.rb -fd will also display necessary specs.

There is a couple of months left at 20-30 minutes per day.
